# PasswordManagerUWP
A simple .NET C#, UWP Password Manager app
This Password Manager app uses simple file-storage of text-files to store credentials on the local PC via a UWP front-end.
There are a couple, or so bugs however the core functionality is running. Outstanding bugs should be looked at and ironed out.
Simply write in the domain and password and save the credentials.
